/**
   Toy model of metropolis sampler.  Data is (are?) one toss of a
   coin, which comes up heads.  Likelihood of data is p, the
   probability of a head.  Prior density of p is uniform, so posterior
   density is

                     p
   Pr[p|heads] = -------- = 2p
                  1
                 int p dp
                  0 

   The goal is to reproduce this using Metropolis.  

   The proposal density is defined as follows:

   1. Draw an observation from a uniform distribution of width w,
   centered on zero, and add it to the current value of the Markov
   Chain.  Call the result y.

   2. If y > 1, then set z = 1 - (y-1).  (In other words, reflect at
   the boundary.)

   3. If y < 0, then set z = -y.  (Another reflection).

   Only one reflection will be needed to ensure that 0 <= z <= 1.
   This proposal distribution is symmetric: The probability of moving
   from x to y is the same as that of moving from y to x.
   Consequently, we can use the Metropolis algorithm without bothering
   with the correction introduced by Hastings.

   Revision History

   1998-3-27 Initial version.  Used a proposal distribution that was
   independent of current value of Markov Chain.  Proposal
   distribution was asymmetric so the Hastings correction was used.

   2001-7-13 Implemented a symmetric proposal distribution, dropped
   the Hastings correction.
